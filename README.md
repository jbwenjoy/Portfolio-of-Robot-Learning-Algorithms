# Portfolio-of-Robot-Learning-Algorithms

My personal portfolio of robot learning algorithms, from course materials in 517 and 650 at UPenn.

* This repository is continuously updated with new algorithms and implementations as I learn them.

* Last updated: 2024-Mar-27

## Table of Contents

1. Optimal Control and Trajectory Optimization: LQR, MPC, Energy Shaping, iLQR, Collocation, Min-snap

2. State Estimation: Kalman Filter, EKF, UKF, Particle Filter

3. Perception: 2D SLAM with PF, NeRF (to be updated)

4. Planning: Dynamic Programming, etc (to be updated)

5. Reinforcement Learning: (to be updated)
